Mini Quilt is stand-alone implementation of the Kaleidoscope theme's colorful way of presenting recent posts as a sidebar element.

== Description ==

Tired of boring lists of recent posts?

Taking advantage of the date to color algorith used in the [Kaleidoscope theme](http://www.ikirudesign.com/themes/kaleidoscope/ "Homepage for the Kaleidoscope WordPress theme"), the Mini Quilt plugin provides a more colorful way of presenting your recent posts. It also provides readers with implicit information about the frequency and grouping of yours posts and looks pretty sweet.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `miniquilt.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Put the Mini Quilt sidebar widget wherever you would like it.
4. (Optional) Customize the size and shape of the patches and quilt by clicking edit on the widget.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin awesome? =

You could say that.

= Was that last one a real question? =

That's not for me to say.

== Screenshots ==

1. An instance of the Mini Quilt appearing on the sidebar of Chris Pearson's [Neoclassical theme](http://pearsonified.com/theme/neoclassical/). The grey square is the post being viewed, the one with a box around has my cursor (which, like ghosts, can't be seen in screenshots) over it.
2. A smaller Mini Quilt on the WordPress default theme.
3. The Mini Quilt sidebar widget can even be used with [the Kaleidoscope theme](http://www.ikirudesign.com/themes/kaleidoscope/) itself. This also show how old posts darken; the last five posts showing on this Mini Quilt are over ten years old.
